Our first meeting for 2024 will be held on Friday morning February 2nd 2024 at Beecroft Presbyterian Church Hall at 10:30 for a 10:45 start with the Investors Discussion group following at 12:30pm after refreshments.


## 10:45am: Central Coast seniors debunk the myths and outline the real benefits of Electric Cars

Margaret McDonald and Hugh Sykes met each other through their mutual love for Electric Vehicles (EV), and they both had so much in common they ended up marrying each other in June 2022, a year after they met. The couple are passionate about the potential for EVs to have a positive impact on climate change, and they will give a talk about these benefits and debunking myths about electric vehicles.
