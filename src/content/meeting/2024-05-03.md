The Stroke Foundation recommends the F.A.S.T. test as an easy way to remember the most common signs of stroke. Using the F.A.S.T. test involves asking these simple questions:

- **F**ace: Check their face. Has their mouth drooped?
- **A**rms: Can they lift both arms?
- **S**peech: Is their speech slurred? Do they understand you?
- **T**ime: Is critical. If you see any of these signs call 000 straight away.
