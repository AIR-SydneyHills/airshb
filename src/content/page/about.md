## Who is AIR?

The Australian Independent Retirees (A.I.R.) Limited is a volunteer organisation working to advance and protect the interests and independent lifestyle of Australians aged 50+ who are, or plan to be, fully or partly self-funded in retirement. The Association is a national not-for-profit organisation formed in 1990. AIR does not support any one political party but works towards ensuring all parties recognise the issues that are important to retirees.

Our tagline is **“Independence Matters”**.

Most of the issues facing self-funded retirees now and in the future are controlled nationally therefore it is important to speak with a united voice to ensure your concerns are heard.

“I believe that we need to have choice and control over our lives – we need to strengthen the rights of older people in a range of fields – including health, employment, finances, housing, energy and communications.” Member comment - AIR Member survey

Did you know that 43% of Australians at retirement age will be self-funded by 2023? (ASFA 2019) So let’s make an impact on Government policy and perceptions together.
